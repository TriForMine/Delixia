## üéÆ Core Gameplay Mechanics

1.  **Order Management**: Orders appear in the UI, each tied to a customer seat (chair) and a timer ‚è±Ô∏è. The UI visualizes the required ingredients and processing steps needed for the final dish.
2.  **Ingredient Procurement**: Grab base ingredients (Rice üçö, Nori, Salmon üêü, Ebi üç§, Sea Urchin) from designated Stock points (crates/fridges).
3.  **Food Preparation**:
    *   **Processing**: Stations like the Oven transform ingredients over time (e.g., Rice -> Cooked Rice). Server manages timers; visual effects (particles, progress bar) are shown client-side.
    *   **Combining**: Use the Chopping Board to combine ingredients according to recipes (e.g., Cooked Rice + Nori = Onigiri). Some recipes *upgrade* existing items already on the board by adding more ingredients (e.g., Onigiri + Salmon -> Salmon Nigiri).
4.  **Plating & Serving Boards**:
    *   Obtain clean Plates from a Plate Stock.
    *   Place finished dishes onto a Plate (usually on a Serving Board or directly in hand if holding a plate).
    *   Use Serving Boards as intermediate holding spots for plates and/or final dishes, allowing transfer between players.
5.  **Serving & Scoring**: Deliver the correct plated dish to the customer seat (chair interactable) associated with the order before the timer expires to score points. Serving the wrong dish results in a penalty and leaves a dirty plate.
6.  **Dirty Plates**: After serving (correctly or incorrectly), the chair receives a dirty plate that must be picked up and disposed of in the Trash before a new order can be served there.
7.  **Trash**: Dispose of unwanted ingredients, plates (clean or dirty) in the Trash bin.
8.  **Game Phases**:
    *   **Lobby**: Players gather in a waiting room before the game starts. The host can initiate the game. Room ID can be copied for invites.
    *   **Playing**: The main gameplay phase where players cooperate to fulfill orders against the round timer.
    *   **Finished**: Game ends when the timer runs out; a Game End screen displays the final score, accompanied by a confetti üéâ celebration.
9.  **Teamwork**: Coordinate actions with other players effectively ‚Äì passing ingredients, managing stations, and delivering orders ‚Äì to maximize the score.

## üó∫Ô∏è Available Map

*   **Japanese Kitchen**: Prepare **Onigiri**, **Ebi Nigiri**, **Salmon Nigiri**, and **Sea Urchin Rolls** in a dynamic, multi-level Japanese-style kitchen featuring various workstations and customer seating areas.

### 3D Engine & Physics (Babylon.js - Client-Side)

*   **3D Rendering**: Powered by **Babylon.js**. Attempts **WebGPU** first, falling back to **WebGL**.
*   **Asset Instantiation**: Map objects (`MapLoader.ts`) and ingredient/item models (`IngredientLoader.ts`) are loaded once and efficiently instantiated/cloned to optimize memory and performance.
*   **Physics**: **Havok Physics** engine integrated client-side. `LocalCharacterController` uses shape casting and collision manifold analysis for robust movement, ground checks (`CharacterSupportedState`), and slope handling. Invisible boundary walls prevent players from falling off the map.
*   **Shadows & Performance**: `CascadedShadowGenerator` provides optimized shadows. `PerformanceManager` adjusts shadow quality (map size, blur, filtering) and hardware scaling based on user settings ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') and displays an optional FPS counter.
*   **Environment**: Skybox and `ReflectionProbe` for Image-Based Lighting (IBL). Exponential fog effect applied.
*   **Loading**: Custom loading screen (`CustomLoadingScreen` in `BabylonScene.tsx`) shows progress via `AssetsManager`.
*   **Audio**: `AudioManager` utilizes **Babylon.js Audio Engine v2**, managing sound loading, playback (SFX & Music), volume categories (Master/Music/SFX) from settings, spatial audio for footsteps/interactions, and audio context unlocking.
*   **Input**: `InputManager` handles canvas focus, pointer lock acquisition/release, and unlocks the audio context on user interaction. Pointer lock release automatically pauses the game and shows the In-Game Settings menu.

### Networking & Multiplayer (Colyseus - Client & Server)

*   **Server**: Dedicated **Colyseus** server running on **Bun** (`@colyseus/bun-websockets`) hosted at `delixia-server.triformine.dev`. Provides high I/O performance.
    *   **Dev Tools**: Includes **Playground** (`http://localhost:2567`) and **Monitor** (`http://localhost:2567/monitor`, login `admin:admin`) for local development.
*   **State Synchronization**: Uses Colyseus `Schema` (`GameRoomState`, `Player`, `InteractableObjectState`, `Order`) for efficient real-time state synchronization.
*   **Room Management**: Features a lobby (`LobbyRoom`) for listing available games and game rooms (`GameRoom`). Game rooms can be public or private (password protected). Custom React hooks (`use-colyseus.ts`, `colyseus.ts`) simplify client integration and handle connection status, errors, and reconnection logic.
*   **Client-Side Smoothing**: `RemoteCharacterController` uses interpolation (Vector3.Lerp, Quaternion.Slerp) and velocity prediction for smooth remote player movement.
*   **Network Throttling**: Client (`GameEngine.ts`) sends movement/state updates at a throttled rate based on movement thresholds (position, rotation) and time intervals to reduce network traffic. Server broadcasts state efficiently using Schema diffing.

### Game Logic & Gameplay (Server-Authoritative)

*   **Character Controllers (Client)**:
    *   `LocalCharacterController`: Manages player input (using configurable keybindings from `settingsStore`), `ArcRotateCamera` control (with collision detection and sensitivity settings), physics interactions, animation blending (`CharacterState`), spatial footstep sounds, and character mesh fading when the camera is too close.
    *   `RemoteCharacterController`: Replicates server state (position, rotation, animation, held items/plate) using interpolation and plays spatial footstep sounds based on replicated state.
*   **Interaction System**: Client (`LocalCharacterController` + `GameEngine`) uses a `SpatialGrid` to efficiently find the nearest interactable object. On interaction input (`E` key by default), a message is sent to the server. The server (`InteractionService.ts`) validates the action based on the authoritative `GameRoomState` (player inventory, object state, recipe logic, etc.) and updates the state if valid. State changes are broadcast back to all clients. Specific error messages (`cannotInteract`, `alreadyCarrying`, etc.) are sent back to the originating client on invalid actions.
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Player
        participant Client (LocalController)
        participant Client (GameEngine)
        participant Server (GameRoom/InteractionService)
        participant All Clients

        Player->>Client (LocalController): Press 'E' near Object
        Client (LocalController)->>Client (GameEngine): tryInteract() finds nearest object (SpatialGrid)
        Client (GameEngine)->>Server (GameRoom/InteractionService): Send 'interact' { objectId }
        Server (GameRoom/InteractionService)->>Server (GameRoom/InteractionService): Validate Interaction (Player State, Object State, Recipe Logic)
        alt Interaction Valid
            Server (GameRoom/InteractionService)->>Server (GameRoom/InteractionService): Modify GameRoomState (e.g., player.holdedIngredient, object.ingredientsOnBoard)
            Server (GameRoom/InteractionService)-->>All Clients: Broadcast updated GameRoomState (Schema diff)
            All Clients->>All Clients: Apply state changes (Update UI, Character visuals, Object visuals)
        else Interaction Invalid
            Server (GameRoom/InteractionService)-->>Client (GameEngine): Send specific error message (e.g., 'alreadyCarrying')
            Client (GameEngine)->>Client (GameEngine): Play error sound / Show Toast
        end
    ```
*   **Recipe & Cooking Logic (Server)**: `RecipeService.ts` manages processing station timers (like the Oven), validates ingredient combinations for recipes (including upgrades), and updates `InteractableObjectState` upon recipe completion. Handles both instant and timed recipes. Defined in `shared/recipes.ts`. Client (`InteractableObject`) displays progress bars and cooking particle effects based on state updates.
*   **Order & Score Management (Server)**: `OrderService.ts` generates new orders at intervals, assigns them to available chairs, manages deadlines, validates serving attempts against orders, updates the score, and handles chair state (available, disabled, dirty plate). `GameTimerService.ts` manages the overall round timer and triggers game end.
*   **Item System (Shared)**: Definitions for all ingredients and plates in `shared/items.ts`. Visual configurations (offsets, scales when held/placed on hand/board/plate) in `shared/visualConfigs.ts`.
*   **Customers (Client/Server)**: Server assigns orders to specific `ServingOrder` interactable IDs (chairs). Client (`GameEngine`) spawns/despawns visual customer models (chick/chicken with spawn/despawn animations and particle effects) at chair locations based on active orders and displays a 3D UI element above them showing the ordered item icon and a time-remaining progress bar.

### Map Configuration and Loading

*   **Shared Definition**: Map layout, object placements, and interactable properties are defined in `shared/maps/japan.ts` using a structured `MapModelConfig` format validated by Zod schemas (`mapUtils.ts`).
*   **Deterministic IDs & Hashing**: Interaction IDs are automatically generated (`generateInteractionId` in `mapUtils.ts`) based on type, ingredient, and index for consistency across client/server. A **SHA-256 hash** of the entire map configuration is generated (`generateMapHash`).
*   **Server Loading**: `ServerMapLoader` processes the map config to initialize `InteractableObjectState` instances in the `GameRoomState` and stores the calculated map hash in the room state.
*   **Client Loading**: `MapLoader` loads 3D models (using instantiation), creates client-side `InteractableObject` representations, and **verifies the client's calculated map hash against the server's hash** received in the initial room state. A warning toast is shown on mismatch.

    ```mermaid
     graph TD
        A["Shared Config File (japan.ts)"] --> B("Process Config (mapUtils)");
        B -- "Generate IDs & Validate" --> C{"Config with IDs"};

        subgraph Server ["Server Side"]
            E["Server Map Loader"] --> F{"Load Config + Generate IDs"};
            F --> G["Store Server Map Hash in GameRoomState<br>Create InteractableObjectStates"];
        end

        subgraph Client ["Client Side"]
            H["Client Map Loader"] --> I{"Load Config + Generate IDs"};
            I --> J["Calculate Client Map Hash"];
            J --> K{"Compare Hashes"};
            K -- Match --> L["Load 3D Models<br>Create Client InteractableObjects"];
            K -- Mismatch --> M["Show Warning Toast"];
        end

        A --> E;
        A --> H;
        G -- "state.mapHash" --> K;
    ```

### User Interface (UI - Client)

*   **Framework**: **React** (v19 with experimental compiler), **TailwindCSS**, **DaisyUI**. **Motion One** for animations.
*   **Client State Management**: **Zustand** (`useStore`) for global UI state (app mode, username, room joining info).
*   **Colyseus Integration**: Custom React hooks (`useGameColyseusState`, `useLobbyRooms`, etc.) connect components to the Colyseus room/lobby state for reactive updates. `react-hot-toast` used for notifications (errors, success messages). `ToasterWithMax` limits concurrent toasts.
*   **UI Components**:
    *   **Menu**: Main menu with floating emoji decorations, initial username setup prompt if needed.
    *   **Settings**: Full settings screen (`Settings.tsx`) and an In-Game quick options menu (`InGameSettingsMenu.tsx`), both using a shared panel (`SharedSettingsPanel.tsx`) for consistency. Allows configuration of player profile (nickname), controls, graphics, and audio. Includes a "Reset All" confirmation modal.
    *   **Lobby**: Displays connected players, Room ID (with copy button), and Start (Host only)/Leave buttons (`LobbyUI.tsx`).
    *   **Room List**: Displays available public game rooms with details (name, players, created time). Includes search functionality and buttons to Create Room or Quick Play (`RoomList.tsx`). Handles joining private rooms via a modal (`JoinPrivateRoomModal.tsx`).
    *   **Create Room**: Separate page to configure and create a new game room (name, max players, private/password) (`CreateRoomPage.tsx`).
    *   **In-Game**: Heads-up display including Timer, Score, Held Item indicator, and Orders panel (`GameUI.tsx`, `Timer.tsx`, `Score.tsx`, `HeldItemUI.tsx`, `Orders.tsx`). The Orders panel visually breaks down recipe steps by station and ingredient.
    *   **End Screen**: Shows final score with a confetti effect (`GameEndScreen.tsx`).

### Tooling & Environment

*   **Bundler**: **Rsbuild**.
*   **Runtime**: **Bun**.
*   **Language**: **TypeScript** (v5.x).
*   **Formatting/Linting**: **Biome**.
*   **Containerization**: **Dockerfile** for the server build (optimized multi-stage build). `.dockerignore` configured.
*   **CI/CD & Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow for client build/deployment (GitHub Pages & Cloudflare Pages). Server deployment uses Docker (managed separately). `.env` files for environment configuration.
